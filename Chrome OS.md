# The Ultimate Extension Platform for AI
## The One Key Fact
Chrome OS runs **full desktop Chrome** with complete extension APIs. iPads and Android tablets run mobile Chrome with severe limitations. This changes everything.
## What Chrome OS Extensions Can Do
**Exclusive Chrome OS APIs** (not even on desktop):
• `chrome.fileSystemProvider` - Mount virtual file systems
• `chrome.input.ime` - Create custom keyboards  
• `chrome.virtualKeyboard` - Control on-screen keyboard
• `chrome.wallpaper` - System wallpaper control
**Full Desktop APIs**:
• `chrome.tabCapture` - Record any tab's audio/video
• `chrome.desktopCapture` - Screen recording
• `chrome.usb` - Direct USB device access
• `chrome.system.*` - CPU, memory, display info
**Hardware Access**:
• Accelerometer/Gyroscope - Via DeviceOrientationEvent
• Bluetooth - Full Web Bluetooth API
• Microphone - Continuous recording
• File System - Persistent folder access (no re-prompting!)
## The Perfect AI Device
**Sleep → Recording**: <1 second via Bluetooth media key  
**Battery Life**: 10+ hours with screen off  
**Price**: $300 for Lenovo Duet (vs $700 AI pins)  
**Form Factor**: Tablet simplicity, desktop power
## Why Not Other Platforms?
| Platform  | Extension Support  | Hardware Access | Price |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ----- |
| iPad      | None               | App-only        | $449+ |
| Android   | Mobile Chrome only | Limited         | $200+ |
| Laptop    | Full               | Full            | $800+ |
| Chrome OS | Full + Extras      | Full            | $300  |
## The Architecture Fit
Your Cognition gets:
- Service workers that restart in <1 second
- Offscreen documents that persist while screen off  
- Media buttons that wake everything up
- State that survives through chrome.storage
## Bottom Line
You're not buying a tablet that runs an AI assistant.  
You're buying a **fully customizable AI system** that happens to be a $300 tablet.
Extensions are first-class citizens. Hardware is fully accessible. The price is democratized.
**Chrome OS tablets: Where extensions aren't limited - they're empowered.**
