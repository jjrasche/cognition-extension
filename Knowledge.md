The `Knowledge Graph` is your permanent memory - a web of connected ideas, conversations, and insights that grows with you. Unlike folders or documents, it stores information the way you think: as a network of relationships.

```
[Meeting with John] --discusses--> [Project Alpha]
                    --scheduled--> [Tomorrow 3pm]
                    --requires--> [Budget Review]
                    
[Project Alpha] --budget--> [$500k]
                --deadline--> [Q2 2025]
                --team--> [John, Sarah, Mike]
```
When you mention a person, project, or idea, it becomes a node. When you connect thoughts ("this reminds me of..."), it creates relationships. Over time, this builds YOUR unique knowledge structure that the AI can navigate to give you better, more personal responses.

This isn't just storage - it's active memory that modules read from and write to, making your AI truly yours.

When you ask "What do I need for tomorrow's meeting?", the AI traverses these connections to give you context-aware answers.
