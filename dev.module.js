So psychological hurdles to sharing are removed. The more micro societies in existence the more security we have from access to a large mutual aid network and the formation of a stronger political base to protect our minority way of life. There is every advantage to proselytize and aid in conversion- restaurant in village living is how you advertise and grow the community. It represents the communities values and builds relationships with non community members- restaurant, child care, we become a community that draws trade surplus within the community that's a good sign as a model of efficient and valuable economy we should be at a standard that others would envy. We have to be the best so we have motivation. To be an enviable community- #microSociety/goal export more than you import using regenerative means while maintaining a community enviable by the external society's standard of iving- imagine in your house You're only job involved in maintaining the household is to think about your kids nutrition. - imagine instead of doing the laundry sweeping the floor is cleaning the bathrooms cooking cleaning dishes stalking the fridge fixing up the house plowing the driveway taking out the trash going to the grocery store. Instead of all that you just did 5 hours of work and got all of that done for you- Extractive economies: systems where wealth is pulled out of communities rather than reinvested locally. Alternative to a community is lifted up by it's production.- test the viability of a specific micro-society's organizing principles using waitlists. Using digital tools to test and rework concepts with NO INVESTMENT.- If kids can function within a micro society it proves that our current society is the problem and not humanity-  the structures of micro-societies must make it easy for people to make a positive impact in their community.

Are they just makes it easier to dissolve everything if it is a legal entity unto itself I don't want ownership to be something that removes you from the community and reduces your own liquidity in the concept - communal living, are there limitations on how much money can buy you external economy money can buy you like there needs to be an exchange rate between external and internal but you can't just buy your way into this you need to invest in the community some way other than your money probably I'm not sure - internal economy, communal living, you need some way to give people opportunity to engage with services that are not communal that they don't want like energy healing or some shit I wouldn't want that but I want a means for two people within the economy to exchange something for that if they so choose - is education handled by the internal or external economy?

What are the founding principles are they you spend one hour a week doing something for the community How do you track that How do you encourage that communal dinners every Friday...- communal living carpool or communal cars - I like the idea of village living Luna You're so close in these condos that you can walk by somebody's back door and hear them complaining or yelling or having a little fight. It's private enough where you can do that in peace but you can also be exposed to some of the community humanity aspects of everybody's lives. Maybe it's a stepping stone to communal living maybe you go where people already lives in small areas I mean there's really great line here between suburbs and condos around the lake life is a different it's an aggregated there's something there to draw people I'm essentially doing what Zach Johnson said to do or said was unique about his neighborhood was someone said it felt like a lake house because of all active people were I think that's the thing I want that and shared but I think you can create that through like a closer living shared assets responsibility. Or even the lake is a common centralizing tool What other things are there that are centralizing assets other than a lake That's for recreation I mean if you have people put together for not recreation but for sustenance for for living. It's interesting how opulence kind of removes the communal aspect Is there an inherent move to individuality and privacy and  unquote freedom the richer you are in the more resources you have are we instinctually ones who push out to be as individualistic and independent as we can what's the force that's drawing us back What is that communal niche that need What brings people together What makes people as a commute as a society contract live closer together engaged collectively on Ames without the exchange of money I'm talking about a commune but what's the gradient between suburbs and commune- communal living, bartering and time banks but you can make it a free market I can eat market your skills and then you're just using your experience as capital and your ability so what kind of fun does time bank fund is there like for redistricting to redistribution of time. If you think of time as a market then you're just using money as an exchange. It's still an exchange though I think that's what's the bad thing. So the straws on the idea of what's the minimal investment in a community that you have to agree upon to be in that community and then you essentially make it a free market around prioritizing skills people adapt the skills and redistribute back anything if just depending on how I guess you agree upon that by a community how many hours how much time demandate of a person to the community and how much per week month whatever and how much and what can you expect for that What is the value of each skill How do you what are you incentivizing and incentivizing that so how much what's the minimum effort per person required, What you do you as a community incentivize, What kind of safety net do you offer if someone can't give time, What is enforcement mechanism- How much do you like to own stuff communal living- communal living, I like being served and I like serving- communal living, what is the gray area between work you have to do and work you want to do?

Let's say each fish has 1 lb of meat 500 calories and and the fish contains 20% protein by mass. That comes out to 250,000 calories and 45,000 g of protein per acre per year- average person might need 25,000 g of protein a year and 900,000 calories. So if a community is getting half of its protein from fish you would need 1/4 acre of well stocked intensively managed fish farm per person- list all of the basic needs of community and the time requirements of the person time requirements to maintain those and divide that evenly amongst the community How many hours per person per week would that be- should all know something for a modern economy and our ancient economy - What are the mechanisms by which individuals interact with the internal and external economy Is there an exchange mechanism.

No you would use fear. And it's fear of the other that would cause us kind of conflict between these thousand person groups. You will have external stressors. I believe it's possible to build a perfect system This is a core difference between John and myself. I did so to his emotion of think about the things that could go wrong with this credibly so. I am trying to isolate on the mental which is problem solving like let's build a better wheel. - Is there a formula for to create resilient communities?

The AI would use as primary source the community's democratically agreed upon cultural framework, bylaws, and basic need mandates (housing, food, water, waste, basic healthcare, electricity, internet).

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.

RackhamBut I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?Section 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, written by Cicero in 45 BCAt vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.1914 translation by H. RackhamOn the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.help@lipsum.comPrivacy Policyso the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?Section 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, written by Cicero in 45 BCAt vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

RackhamOn the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.Where can I get some?There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.5	paragraphs	words	bytes	lists	Start with 'Loremipsum dolor sit amet...'Donate: If you use this site regularly and would like to help keep the site on the Internet, please consider donating a small sum to help pay for the hosting and bandwidth bill.

The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.help@lipsum.comPrivacy Policyso the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.Where can I get some?There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.5	paragraphs	words	bytes	lists	Start with 'Loremipsum dolor sit amet...'Donate: If you use this site regularly and would like to help keep the site on the Internet, please consider donating a small sum to help pay for the hosting and bandwidth bill.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?Section 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, written by Cicero in 45 BCAt vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio.

RackhamOn the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
