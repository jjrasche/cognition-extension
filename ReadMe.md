# Cognition Extension
## Vision
a knowledge companion that grows more helpful as you use it.

Imagine an AI assistant that truly extends your mind - not another app to switch to, but an ambient intelligence that listens, remembers, and acts on your behalf while you work. `Cognition` runs continuously in your browser, built from simple pieces of code (modules) you choose based on your needs, creating a personalized AI that grows with you.

Speak naturally. `Cognition` maintains context across everything - your browser tabs, your calendar, your files. It remembers your projects, your people, your ideas. Unlike traditional assistants, you build `Cognition` from modules that match your workflow, creating an AI that's uniquely yours.
## Key Principles
üéØ **Modular by Design** - Install only the capabilities you need  
üß† **Continuous Context** - Maintains state across interactions   
üîß **Open** - Every module is readable, modifiable, and under ~500 lines  
üîí **Private** - Your data stays yours, stored where you choose  
üöÄ **Ambient** - Runs in the background, activated by voice or events  

## Project Status
- Near Term Goal: Semantic search that actually works
### What Works:
‚úÖ Modules communicate across 3 contexts of Chrome extension (service worker, extension page, and offscreen document)
‚úÖ Integrated module testing capabilitites
‚úÖ Local embedding models running
‚úÖ LLM providers connected (Claude, GROQ)
‚úÖ Graph-DB running on IndexedDB
‚úÖ Proof of Concepts for: OAuth, web search, and api
‚úÖ Basic UI
### Work In Progress:
‚ùå Testable quality chunking
‚ùå Testable quality Graph 
‚ùå Graph Retreival from prompt
