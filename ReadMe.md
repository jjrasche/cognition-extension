## Big STuff
Throughout this documentation, I am referring to the entity made up by persistant memory, state, and infernece as `Cognition`.
## Quick Start
### 1. Install Your First Build (2 minutes)
1. Visit [voicebrain.ai/marketplace](https://voicebrain.ai/marketplace)
2. Select modules:
   - âœ“ Audio Capture (required)
   - âœ“ Transcription (required)
   - âœ“ LLM Service (required)
   - âœ“ Any others you want
3. Click "Build My Extension"
4. Install the downloaded .crx file
### 2. First Voice Command
1. Click the Cognition icon in your browser
2. Say: "Start listening"
3. Say: "What can you do?"
4. Watch your personalized AI respond based on your modules
### 3. Explore Your Capabilities
Each module adds new abilities. With the starter pack:
- **Navigation**: "Go to my email", "Switch to the GitHub tab"
- **Knowledge**: "Remember this idea", "What did I say about Project X?"
- **Tasks**: "Add a task to review the proposal"
## Core Concepts
### Modules: Your Building Blocks
Each module is a single capability that does one thing well. Like apps on your phone, you choose which ones to install. Modules can:
- Listen to your voice
- Control your browser  
- Store your knowledge
- Connect to services
- Create custom UI
### Your Second Brain
The knowledge graph stores information the way you think - as a network of connected ideas. Unlike folders, it grows with you and helps the AI understand YOUR context.
### Zero Friction Philosophy
No switching apps. No copy-paste. No remembering commands. Just speak naturally and your AI figures out which modules to use.

## Philosophy
We believe AI assistants should:
1. **Amplify** what you can do, not replace you
2. **Adapt** to your workflow, not force you into theirs
3. **Compose** from simple pieces you understand
4. **Respect** your privacy and data ownership
