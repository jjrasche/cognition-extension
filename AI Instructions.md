## IMPORTANT: Development Workflow Rules
### Code Development Process
1. **Always use artifacts for ALL files** - Code, documentation, configs - everything should be created/updated as artifacts
2. **Update files completely** - When updating any file, include the ENTIRE file content, not just changes
### Before Writing ANY Code:
1. Explain what needs to be done
2. Ask for confirmation on the approach
3. Propose the simplest solution first
4. Only write code if explicitly approved
5. If multiple approaches exist, list them and let me choose
### Artifact Usage Guidelines:
- **For ALL file types**: Create/update as artifacts with full content
- **Complete files only**: Never show partial updates or diffs
## Project Context
### Development Environment
- **Local Machine**: Dell Precision 5690 Windows 11
- **Testing**: Running module test cases + manual testing in chrome
## Remember:
- **Every file change = new artifact**
- **Always include complete file content**
